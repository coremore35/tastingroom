      "This game is one of my favorite games of all time. I love all aspects of the game: the interesting characters you play with the different stories and stats, the events, items, and omens that change the game, and just the pure variety of game play you get with every time you play. The many room tiles and the 50 haunts have infinite amount of possibility for any outcome that might occur. Overall, the game gives off such a great, creepy vibe that adds to the game play and it's an adventure that all my friends enjoy and want more of. "

      "Seems to scratch my CCG itch to some extent, an itch I've ignored for close to a decade now. It's feels good to finally scratch it. I love the interact of the cards and how some games have a lot of interaction between players and other games have none. It makes every game very different. However, I have found that some cards can be almost completely useless if they aren't paired up with the correct card(s). So I guess you need to make the occasional executive decision and opt out a set of cards for another."

      "A complete abomination. I must admit it is well developed, balanced, and streamlined. However, there is very little fun here and even the few take that moments or clever plays I could manage within the game's framework didn't really effect the outcome. The rulebook is so awful and repetitive that we had more fun reading it than we did playing this cluster**** of a euro."

    gamePlayNotes:
      "I love games in which you can benefit from other players' moves. If you have one survivor in a boat with two of an opponent's survivors, you can rely on that opponent to move the boat. Thus, your survivor moves without you having to use part of your turn, increasing your action economy. Also, you have a second person fighting to keep the whales, sharks, and sea monsters away from that boat."

      "Pure, cotton-candy fun. This game gives me everything I want in a rampaging-monster dexterity game: Demolish buildings! Throw tanks and buses! Use your breath weapon to blow soldiers off a building! Gobble up meeples without mercy! Punch other monsters in the face! If you care a lot about winning, the superpowers, powers, and character cards seem pretty obviously unbalanced but (a) I don't care that much, personally, and (b) you can pretty easily cull the worst offenders from each deck or forego them entirely."

      "Here's a case where you have a great idea for a game, and lovely art and components, which doesn't work in practice. The overlapping bridges balance precariously on the supports, and are so fiddly that we knocked them over nearly every turn. I wish I could recommend it as it's exactly the sort of game we should love, but I just can't."

      "A fun game that uses it's theme very well. Building the bamboo forest is fun and I do like the strategy in this game of fulfilling your objective card requirements while not setting your opponents up too much. That and it is just a very nice looking game. Pleasantly surprised by this game."

      'Perfect game for large groups of players familiar with it. Only detraction is it can take a while to teach and grasp and the pictograms on the cards are not always easy to decipher without the rulebook. Quick turns, no player elimination, and fun theme. Lots of different strategies and ways to win, varies widely game to game.'

      'Board games do not get more thematic than this! I was reluctant to get this game, even though I love the theme, as I was unsure about the application. I do not like computer games, but this is nothing like that. The application supports the game very well. Actually, it supports the game so well that you can play this alone. I am not a solitaire gamer, but I really enjoyed my solo play of this game. Yes, it is a bit fiddly when playing alone, as you are managing two character.'
